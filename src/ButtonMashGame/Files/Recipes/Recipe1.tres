 - 2 large eggs (room temperature)
 - 1 cup granulated sugar
 - 1 stick butter (1/2 cup), room temperature
 - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
 - 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
 - 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
 - pinch of salt
 - 1/2 cup milk

[b]Instructions[/b]
 - Line a muffin pan with cupcake liners and preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
 - Using an electric mixer, beat together eggs and granulated sugar. Once combined, add
	softened butter and vanilla. Mix until creamy.
 - In a small bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt.
 - Alternating with the milk, add dry ingredients to egg and sugar mixture in three
	equal increments. Mix well.
 - Scoop cupcake batter into the lined muffin pan, filling each cavity about 2/3rds
	of the way. Bake for 17-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean when
	poked through the center.

	minutes. Remove each cake from the pan and cool completely on a wire rack.
