 - Pour the vegetable oil into a plastic bag (a produce bag works well). Add the potato slices, and shake to coat.
 - Coat a large dinner plate lightly with oil or cooking spray. Arrange potato slices in a single layer on the dish.
 - Cook in the microwave for 3 to 5 minutes, or until lightly browned (if not browned, they will not become crisp).
