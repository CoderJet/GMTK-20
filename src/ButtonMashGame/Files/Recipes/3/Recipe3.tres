		sliced onion and drizzle over the oil. Roast for 15 mins.

		the sausages then return to the oven and cook for a further 35
		mins or until the sausages are cooked through and the
		batter is golden on top.
	- To make the gravy, heat a deep frying pan or saucepan and fry
		the remaining onion in the oil for 5 mins until golden.
		Sprinkle over the flour and cook, stirring until thickened. Add
		the mustard, Worcestershire sauce and, gradually, the stock,
		stirring until smooth and thickened to your liking.
