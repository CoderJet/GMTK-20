Subject: We need to chit-chat

Dear Jill,
I'll always have a special place in my heart for you. At times, our relationship felt
like it was the best thing that had ever happened to me, but lately, everything has
felt wrong. It pains me to admit this, but my love for you has faded away.

I can't stay in a relationship when some one kicks my dog while dancing to Led Zeplin.

Sincerely,
Trevor
